Useful timely book with information on how to decentralize and disperse data and turn data into data product,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh in Action
"I'm about half way through the book, didn't want to wait till I finish to write a review.This book covers all the important aspects of architecting an AWS ML solution. It addresses not only the major popular ML services such as SageMaker, it also looks into the data engineering ETL services offered by AWS such as Glue, AWS Lambda, Athena, and others.As a data engineer myself, this is an excellent book for me to learn and understand how cloud data pipelines are implemented in ML and data science architecture. I also love the hands-on exercises, easy to follow.For those who may be new to the AWS cloud, and feel overwhelmed with the number of various services in the AWS ecosystem, this book will easily save many hours of research and get right to the point. I strongly recommend this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Machine Learning Solutions Architect Handbook: Create machine learning platforms to run solutions in an enterprise setting
"What an incredible and practical book! I was a novice at ML before reading this. David starts from the basics in plain English, moves on to actually create on AWS each building block of an ML platform for the enterprise, covering every aspect to make it operational in a business. Bravo. It also forced me to learn Python, which is never a waste of time. Highly recommended for any CIO/CTO/CDO, and everyone in their team.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Machine Learning Solutions Architect Handbook: Create machine learning platforms to run solutions in an enterprise setting
"Machine learning solutions architect handbook by David Ping is a must read for all levels of data scientist, ML engineers and data science/analytics executives. This book covers the length and breadth of building and operationalizing ML models with open source tools and also AWS AI services. Though this book covers the ML environment in AWS, it covers various facets of ML model building, deployment, maintenance and governance.I feel this book serves various personas in AI/ML domain:1.Data scientists could expand their knowledge on how to train and serve large scale models.2.ML engineers/solution architects could expand their knowledge on Kubernetes & AWS features to build enterprise scale data science/ML platforms.3.Data science/analytics leaders could learn about various AI/ML use cases, AWS AI services and get familiarized with various AWS tools in AI/ML architecture.This book not only provides tutorials for in-depth understanding of the concepts but also is easy to understand if one wants to get a high level overview. Highly recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Machine Learning Solutions Architect Handbook: Create machine learning platforms to run solutions in an enterprise setting
"I bought this book to learn what a ML solutions architect does as I have not seen a similar book like this. It is very clear that the author is an expert practitioner in the space.  In the book, the author referenced his own personal experiences in building ML solutions for real-world use cases. And he covers the science, technology, and governance considerations for putting ML into production.  Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Machine Learning Solutions Architect Handbook: Create machine learning platforms to run solutions in an enterprise setting
"I highly recommend this book for people with cloud experience to learn ML.  This book introduces to the reader the different data science, ML technology, ML architecture, and business topics in a way that’s easy to understand.

"I just read the book “The Machine Learning Solutions Architect Handbook” by my colleague at Amazon Web Services, David Ping. I was honored that Packt reached out to me to ask if I would post my thoughts about the book and provided me with an advanced copy of the book.Onto the book itself. This book successfully takes on a complex challenge of presenting both the fundamentals of machine learning, while also diving deep into concrete discussions and architectures of how to actually execute ML workloads at production scale.What I liked most about this book is that while the author gives an excellent overview of how to deploy AI/ML workloads on AWS* specifically, he also spends many pages explaining the fundamentals of machine learning in an organized, clear manner in the context of business enterprise workloads. This book addresses real-life questions like:  * What types of business problems and use cases are amenable to AI/ML?  * How, on a basic level, does AI/ML work? What are common algorithms used nowadays?  * What are the frequently used AI/ML libraries, and how do they work?  * What are the most commonly used solutions for AI/ML orchestration?This book does a good job of answering questions like this and many others. Reading this book will give you a strong sense of how to architect AI/ML workloads for scale, reproducibility and with proper governance and orchestration. In addition, the code within the repository associated with the book gives readers a good place to start in a hands-on fashion.This book especially fills an important niche for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to expand their horizons into the infrastructure of doing AI/ML at scale. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand what designing and productionizing AI/ML workloads is all about.*See Chapter 8 specifically for a great example of deploying ML workloads using Amazon SageMaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Machine Learning Solutions Architect Handbook: Create machine learning platforms to run solutions in an enterprise setting

"Das Buch wurde uns im Studium (DataScience) vorab als Grundlage/Basiswerk nahegelegt. Es ist super verständlich geschrieben und deckt die wesentlichen Punkte ab, die man beim Beschaffen und Aufbereiten, sowie Analysieren und Präsentieren von Daten dringend befolgen sollte. Absolute Kaufempfehlung! Mittels Python wird anhand von mächtigen Bibliotheken gezeigt, wie man Daten direkt aus dem Internet (incl. versch.

"This book overall is excellent if you have a background in statistics. I can't imagine the introductory chapter on univariate statistics is sufficient for understanding the complexity of regression models covered later in the book, for instance survival analysis. I would not recommend this book for someone without a background in regression models.A small criticism is that though the author does discuss the assumption of regression models, he does not go into great detail on the diagnostic methods. For someone trying these models for the first time, this could lead to error if you do not look elsewhere for more info.Application of analytic models is the theme of this book, and in that regard it excels. My doctorate included several biostatistics and epidemiology courses, and this book was excellent in providing new extensions of those methods to marketing and showing me how to think like a marketer. I also learned plenty of new things, like latent class analysis for segmentation, and simultaneous equations, which were fun chapters.The book is well written for a fast read. The author intentionally does not go into detail on equations, which is nice for application, less so for thorough understanding. Plenty of resources are recommended in-text though to find greater detail.If you want a book that will introduce you to the application of several analytic marketing methods, many of which are drawn from biostatistics and econometrics, this book is great read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques
"I discover web analytics in 2012, while I was in college studying business marketing. I have been doing web analytics since then. I have always wanted to explore predictive analytics with some python libraries. This book gave me a better view of statistics. It’s implied marketing analytics for me and there is some wonderful carrier advice as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques
"For those who really understand and love the math-side of analytics, Marketing Analytics is filled with actionable insights and detailed examination of the tools needed to break down any campaign. For those that didn't love math in school, it's going to be way over your head.Author Mike Gridsby displays a deep understanding of incredibly detailed analytic skill. Far more than the typical business is applying to their examination of marketing efforts, this book is for those who really want to dive deep and have a more complete understanding of outcome.While it may not be for most marketers, Marketing Analytics is the most detailed look at marketing analytics out there. If you're in charge of data and analytic at your company, grab a copy and gain a better understanding of detailed examination.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques

I look forward if he comes out with a third book",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques
"A bit of a strange book, confused as to its audience. Maybe.It's a bit like that college professor that covers the basic material just cause the department makes it so, then proceeds to hammer you with terse explanations and somewhat unhelpful generalizations.Listen to this, the author spends ten pages covering all of statistics from the basic definition of means all the way to probability. Yeah, and that's fine but why waste that space when you then spend 6 pages explaining what panel regression is and how to use it? And by the way, half of those pages are just tables of statistical output...And so on for most of the chapters.You do get the sense that the author is overly concerned with breadth rather than depth, and it shows in how shallow some of his chapter read. It's basically a survey of methods rather than a textbook approach to marketing analytics.The last chapter where he recounts personal experiences in his career all the way from shoe salesman to Ph.D. in tensor analysis is pretty darn good and great practical advice.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques

"There is great clarity in Mike Grigsby's book.  The tools are simple and powerful.  The book reads through quickly.  The best and more important value of this book is that it shows how you can be tactical, immediate and responsive while being 100% consumer-focused.

A great read. I learned a lot! It really helped me with my Marketing Analytics class. I recommend reading if you are going into this field of work.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques
Initially enjoyed it but stopped reading because the book fails to explain how numbers are calculated - you often end up having to do Google searches when the book should explain step by step how numbers are reached. This I found with its ordinary regression table on page 42! In essence the numbers calculate are incorrect and therefore doesn't give you confidence to apply in other situations. Such a shame!,2.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques
"This is an outstanding book and by far the best machine learning book of the several I have read. I highly recommend.1) The author writes this in a way that you can perform machine learning tasks in R without any prior experience using R or ML. He gets you up to speed quickly on how to download R Studio and explains everything you need to know about R in order to perform the ML tasks that are described later in the book. He doesn't explain all of the things you can do in R as in many other books, because you don't necessarily need to know everything about R to perform ML tasks and this book is about ML. So this is obviously not a book that is exhaustive of everything possible in R.2) The structure of this book is outstanding and very logical. Within each of the chapters on Machine Learning models, he describes the model and how it works, includes a section covering the model's syntax in R, the strengths and weaknesses of each model, compares the model to the prior models discussed, and then uses that foundation to walk you through an example of applying each model to real data. Within the examples, he uses the 5 steps of a modeling process: 1) collecting data, 2) exploring and prepping the data, 3) training the model, 4) evaluating model performance, and 5) Improving model performance. I love this structure!3) His explanations of everything are outstanding. I've read several ML books and he by far is the best at explaining things in a way that people can clearly understand. If the model involves statistical concepts, he explains what you need to know very well.4) The book covers many ML models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Classification Rules, Regression, Regression Trees, Model Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Association Rules, K-Means Clustering, and Random Forests. For an advanced Data Scientist, this may not seem like an exhaustive list. However, I feel that for a beginning data scientist or someone that is just interested in getting a good overview of data modeling, I feel this is a great choice of model coverage.Bottom line- if you're at all interested in machine learning in R, this is the book to get. If you're already an advanced data scientist with years of experience, this may not be the best text for you, though.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling 3rd Edition
"I'd have to say that this book is a simple and clear concise introduction to both R and ML. Probably one of the best books on ML with R I've used. It starts of with a robust introduction to R and stats that'll give you the tools to play around with R. Next, the book goes into the ML with good illustrations using physical representations for easier understanding. It goes on to some vector/component concepts in SVM (obviously) but still retains the intuitive properties of the book.  The book chapters, generally, are independent and can be read as stand alone without much loss in understanding.  Overall, a great book to give you the confidence to move forward in ML.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling 3rd Edition
Really like how it goes through all of the major models and is easy to read.

"I received the book just recently. I will update my review of the contents later. Two things I noticed right away are (a) The 'dataspelunking.com' website mentioned above (in the Amazon description) and in the book, is an empty shell; and (b)  The link in the preface pointing to a page containing a PDF of color-images of the screenshots/diagrams in the book is broken, leading to a 404 message. The kindest thing one can say about this is that the book has been rushed to publication and released before the associated resources are ready. At worst this is a misrepresentation. While those color figures are not a big loss, this carelessness does not bode well for the attention to detail with which the book was produced, especially since it is in its 3rd edition.Edited: Packt repaired the broken link and contacted me here to point that out.

"So my issue with this book isn't that it's introductory. I think that fact is quite obvious, actually. My main issues are as follows:First of all, some of the code is just...odd. The author writes bizarre code that is oddly inefficient and imparts the use of inefficient code on beginners. For example, if he shows us how to extract labels for rows x to y and the labes are in a column in a dataframe, he shows us how extracts all the columns for rows x to y and then subsets out the column of interest...why???And second, i wish there was a little more thought into how the book was organized. Not in the order of chapters, but in how the chapters and example problems are appraoched. For example, the author cites packages and tells the reader to install them as they are used in a problem, instead of at the beginning. It would have been very helpful, for example, if at the beginning of each chapter, the packages and datasets used were listed, with links if applicable. Having to stop following the example problems just to install and load a package is quite annoying.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling 3rd Edition
"I honestly hate this book, but I'm sure there are positive points to it somewhere. My biggest problem right now is the index.

"Incredibly well done follow-up to the first two volumes of Silverston's data model series (see my reviews for ""The Data Model Resource Book Volume 1 (Revised Edition): A Library of Universal Data Models for All Enterprises"" and ""The Data Model Resource Book Volume 2 (Revised Edition): A Library of Universal Data Models by Industry Types""). As discussed in the introduction to this book, while the first volume answered the question ""Where can we find a book showing a standard way to model common data model structures?"" and the second volume extended the template models presented in the first volume by adding additional data model constructs that are industry specific, this third volume answers the question ""How can we quickly extend and customize these models for our organization and our needs to quickly develop any data model with higher quality, even if it is specific to our enterprise?""The patterns that Silverston and Agnew present are categorized into chapters entitled ""Setting Up Roles: What Parties Do"", ""Using Roles: How Parties Are Involved"", ""Hierarchies, Aggregations, and Peer-to-Peer Relationships: The Organization of Similar Data"", ""Types and Categories: The Classification of Data"", ""Status: The States of Data"", ""Contact Mechanisms: How to Get in Touch"", and ""Business Rules: How Things Should Work"". Each chapter is well laid out, similar in style to other books of this genre such as ""Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. In this text, each pattern is laid out in its own section that answers the following questions: ""Why Do We Need This Pattern?"", ""How Does This Pattern Work?"", ""When Should This Pattern Be Used?"", and ""What Are the Weaknesses of the Pattern?""In addition, an aspect of this book that this reviewer especially appreciates is a presentation of each pattern at different levels. While the data management industry habitually refers to conceptual, logical, and physical data models, because there are widely different views as to the definition and purpose behind each of these types of data models (this reviewer is all too familiar with this inconsistency from his consulting engagements), the authors devised four levels of patterns that span from the most static and the more specific (Level 1) to the most flexible and more ""generalized"" (Level 4). The authors explain that the two key purposes of a data model are (1) ""to illustrate and communicate information requirements, and (2) ""to provide a sound foundation for a database design"", and because these purposes can obviously be at odds with each other, depending on the stakeholders involved, care needs to be taken during the modeling process to determine appropriateness of approach.While this reviewer offers no suggestions for alternative terminology, the decision of the authors to use the term ""generalization"" to describe the transformation of very specific data model structures to those which more flexibly support data requirements is interesting (especially given their explanation that they chose to do so since the object-oriented community uses the perhaps more intuitive term ""abstraction"" in a different way that has a different meaning) because this reviewer is well aware that software developers also use the term when referring to an object class superset that has object class ""specializations"". But despite this small matter, the consistent focus of the authors on the purpose of each level of data model presented throughout the text for each group of patterns (always discussing Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, and sometimes discussing Level 4) is highly valued by this reviewer, especially when the authors discuss these levels in relationship to the Zachman Framework and other data model classification schemes.This reviewer also enjoyed the last two chapters, entitled ""Using the Patterns"" and ""Socializing the Patterns"", in which the authors answer the questions ""How do I use, apply, and/or implement these patterns in my enterprise?"", ""What is an appropriate balance between requiring adherence to the patterns and allowing them to be used completely optionally and used if and when they are helpful to the modeler/designer?"", ""How do you get your enterprise and various people in the enterprise to adopt these patterns?"", and ""What types of policies or principles regarding use of the patterns would be most appropriate to get the most benefit from these patterns?""In the first of these last two chapters (Chapter 9), the authors demonstrate how the patterns can be used to create different data models that meet different needs, using the different levels of patterns as interchangeable components and combining them to solve common data modeling challenges for circumstances surrounding the building of prototyping and scoping data models, application data models, enterprise data models, data warehouse data models, and master data management (MDM) data models. In the list of additional considerations when using generalized patterns at the end of this chapter, this reviewer appreciates their remark that ""generalized structures move the change process from the typical 'data architect to DBA to developer to tester' process to a data change process, and often organizations have no formal process for data change like they have for application change"" and that ""this can be addressed with organizational commitment to flexible data modeling structures"", especially because this reviewer experienced firsthand the impact on culture when implementing database change management processes at his last two clients.Chapter 10 addresses getting these patterns accepted and used appropriately, discussing in detail many of the objections that one might face in the workplace as well as what the authors see as key to success in this regard: (1) understand motivations and work toward meeting them, (2) develop a clear, common, compelling vision, (3) develop trust, and (4) manage conflict effectively. In addition to understanding the motivations of others, the authors also indicate that understanding one's own motivations is also important. While this last chapter is focused on the data model patterns discussed throughout the text, in the opinion of this reviewer the psychological aspects discussed are applicable to a much broader context in the workplace, and it can only help the industry if more authors choose to address such matters. Well recommended book to all data architects and other data management professionals.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Model Resource Book Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling
"""Universal Patterns for Data Modeling"" is the third volume in The Model Resource Book series.In ""Universal Patterns"", authors and data modeling experts Len Silverston and Paul Agnew examine the recurring patterns that are essential for architects to understand in building and maintaining enterprise data models. The book covers key patterns, including those for party, role, hierarchy, classification, status, communications, and business rules.Modeling methodology guides sometimes are overly prescriptive. However, a strength of the Silverston/Agnew book is that it recognizes that different organizations have different requirements. Each pattern is examined across four ""levels."" A level represents the degree of generality or specificity with which the particular pattern is implemented. Thus, there is no underlying ""one-size-fits-all"" assumption, but rather a framework for thinking about the relative tradeoffs in choosing the  level of generality to match given business requirements.Anyone with a serious interest in data modeling should have all three volumes on their bookshelf. However, Volumme 3, ""Universal Patterns"" is definitely the volume to start with if you have not already bought Volumes 1 and 2. I've joked with Len and Paul that Volume 3, is the ""prequel."" For those who are new to this series, start with Volume 3, then go on to Vol. 1 and 2.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Model Resource Book Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling
Not very practical in use. Someone needs to be engaged in Data Model Pattern level to digest what author is saying about.,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Model Resource Book Vol. 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling
"Unlike the world of Object Oriented programming, there are very few pattern books devoted to data modeling.  This is unfortunate because most business applications suffer from over-specialization & inflexibility in the data model, where change is very expensive.  The few data model patterns books that do exist do not explore the depths of subject to the extent that this book does.Based on their many years of experience, Silverston & Agnew chose to focus on the most common areas of interest (Parties, Roles, Relationships, Statuses, Classifications, Contact Mechanisms, & Rules) and offer a set of data model pattens for each.  Each area has a set of ""pattern levels"" ranging from specific to general, listing benefits, drawbacks, & usage guidelines for each.  The modeler can choose which pattern level best suites the enterprise based on perceived needs.This book can be thought of as the ""gang of four"" book for data modeling.  I would recommend this book for anyone engaging in any form of data modeling.

"I got this book when I was transitioning to doing data science with Python and was struggling to become familiar with standard tools. It's written by the creator of Pandas, and follows the style of the Pandas documentation: dense, telegraphic, peppered with examples.It's hard work because Wes McKinney often does not articulate why you would need to do something (assuming you are already knowledgeable on the underlying process), and writes like an impatient person who would rather be doing something else. Additionally examples often suffer from being both too long and too short - too long in that almost every example is on a toy dataset created from scratch, too short in that most of those datasets have only 5 or 10 elements and do not always showcase complex operations. Other examples (particularly involving time series) have an overabundance of data that make the critical results hard to spot. Frankly, my first month with Pandas was a miserable one.But I give the book 5 stars both because I came to love Pandas as I got more familiar with it, and because while McKinney is not fun to read, he does pack the book with useful information and it is (mostly) well organized. If anything it would benefit from being longer and with a more patient treatment of larger and more concrete datasets (eg the Titanic passenger dataset used in the Pandas documentation). The initial chapter on the basics of using Python could go - if you need this book, then you don't want to be trying to learn the rudiments of Python from it. If you can accept that you'll need a lot of bookmarks or margin notes to get through a rather steep learning curve, it will reward your persistence.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas NumPy and IPython
"This book has been my foundation of using python as a data analyst.This book primarily focuses on the pandas Python library, which is awesome at processing and organizing data (Python pandas is like MS Excel times 100. This is not an exaggeration). It also introduces the reader into numpy (lower level number crunching and arrays), matplotlib (data visualizations), scikitlearn (machine learning), and other useful data science libraries. The book contains other book recommendations for continuing education.Although this would be a challenging book for a brand new Python user, I would still recommend it, especially if you are currently doing a lot of work in MS Excel and/ or exporting data from databases. I had a few false starts learning Python, and my biggest stumbling block was lack of application in what I was learning. This book puts practical tools in the reader's hands very quickly. I personally don't have time to make goofy games etc. that other books have used as practice examples. Despite other reviews criticizing the use of random data throughout the book, I found the examples easy to follow and useful. I would also argue that learning how to generate random data is useful in itself (thus the purpose of the numpy random library), and that there are practical examples throughout the book. Chapter 14 devoted to real-world data analysis examples.I am almost finished with my second time through the book, this time working through every example. This book has been well worth the hours spent in it. For context, I previously relied on Excel, SQL, and some AutoHotKey. This book has significantly improved how I work.Thanks, Wes and team.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas NumPy and IPython
"This book covers all of the basics that you would want to know to get started in programming in Python for data analysis, as the title implies, but it doesn't really offer compelling real-world examples. The data seem to be made up and the analyses don't go into enough detail to help you really learn how pandas and numpy work. Overall this is a decent starter book but you will have to bookmark the python and pandas documentation online if you want to have a reference to all of the functionality those tools have, and there are many places online where you can get better examples to learn from. If you haven't made your mind up about which tool to use for data analysis, I highly recommend checking out dplyr in R, which has an excellent free book online (R for data science, hadley wickham). I find it very easy to learn and it is much easier to set up R and RStudio than it is to set up Python, even though I love Python and Pandas.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas NumPy and IPython
Well written by the creator of Pandas.  The author's copious use of code snippets to illustrate his points makes the material very usable.  The snippets are short enough to type by hand so you get the  frequent opportunity to play with the code and really understand the tools being presented.  And Pandas is awesome!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas NumPy and IPython
"So far, this book has been an inspiring reading. It contains a huge number of data cleansing, transformation, analysis & etc. code snippets. The code is very clean and - for the most part - self-explaining (at least,  for a seasoned software developer). The book step by step displays the motivations behind the design and functionality of center-piece Python modules - and you would not expect anything less from the original designer of Pandas.

"The author covers all the basis in the book but the issue is that the book is a bit convoluted. From a code standpoint the author has a habit of defining function inputs as global variables which is really confusing, ie:B = 10...20 lines of code and 10 pages later...def func(b):  return b + BWhich is poor habit for writing code, and also quite confusing to read. The other part where the book becomes convoluted is its layout. Essentially each chapter breaks down into a number of sections each covering one mathematical operation or idea. So Variance for instance, you get a quick textbook definition of the term, a mathematical proof then the python code. It would have been nice if the author explained the ideas a bit better with non-proofy terminology, in that same vein it would have been nice if the author could have explained the math in his own words so that the reader could understand the intent of the mathematical operations, and not just some quick algebra.

"According to Dr. Hal R.Varian, Google’s Chief Economist, ""The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades."" This 2009 quote talks about a skill known as data storytelling.Dr. Winston's ""Analytics Stories"" does a fantastic job at introducing the reader to data storytelling. He builds over 50 business cases that range from politics to baseball. Dr. Winston uses mostly MS Excel to make sense of data, process it, visualize it and communicate it in a compelling way.For example, chapter 52 applies the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model and extends the application to include demand uncertainty and reorder point. It also illustrates ""the power of two"" rule on inventory management. It sounds quite specialized, and it is, but it is written in a way that is fun to read and very visual. I teach logistics and supply chain management at college level and will use this chapter to teach the EOQ model to my students.On a completely different application, chapter 46 discusses whether roundabouts are a good idea or not.

It reminds me the most of Korner's ""The Pleasure of Counting"" in that each chapter presents a different case/problem/story and outlines the insights and the math used to untangle it. There's a ton of educational value too, aside from the analyses themselves. The topics range from politics, sports, education, policing, divorce, finance, traffic, drafts, etc... Metrics and jargon and clearly explained.It is extremely well documented as well: all sources for articles, texts, data, studies, etc. are cited in-paragraph for the reader's benefit. This alone increased my reading list considerably.The best part of the book is that for most of the chapters, Professor Winston presents a quantitative/statistical analysis of the story using Excel worksheets, which should make it accessible to the non-programming crowd.

In short, the application of Benford’s law is lacking, saying the least. With 214 samples, we can only be 43.3% confident (my calculation) that Madoff cheated. In general, that’s not a high enough confidence level. In general, we aim for 90% or 95%. In summary, the reader gets a basic idea of applying Benford’s law, but that’s it.Don’t get me wrong; it’s an exciting book that tackles many analytics problems.

"I've either read or own nearly all the Bayesian textbooks on the market. They range in presentation from too simple to esoteric and mathematical without clear sense of their application. To date the stand out textbook on the market was McElreath's statistical rethinking... it hits the sweet spot of mathematically rigorous and well written, but hides some of the messier computational details behind a custom R package.What's great about this book is that it is so focused on conveying the essentials of how-to applied computation. The authors make the choice to demonstrate a range of increasingly complex models across two distinct probabilistic programming languages (pymc, tensorflow probability), which forces the reader to grapple with the applied difficulties of shape management and model specification. The  variation of presentation is aided by a free online book with clear code examples and beautiful visuals (generated with Arviz). I was initially sceptical of the choice to use multiple ppls but by presenting two implementation options the reader is forced to focus on what is core to Bayesian  computation rather than details of a specific APIA previous review called this an entry level text, but I'm not sure that does it justice. Some of the examples are of simple datasets but the book is pitched to teach you the mechanics and the whys and wherefores of a Bayesian workflow so you can apply them creatively on your data. I was particularly grateful for the clear discussion of Approximate Bayesian Computation and the Timeseries modelling. The emphasis and attitude to prior and posterior predictive checks for model calibration was well put throughout the text. Plus the code is in Python! This is a big plus for me as I've never worked anywhere where the production environment would tolerate R code...I highly recommend this book as it fills a niche in the market and is cluttered with the wisdom of practiced Bayesian modellers.

"I have purchased the textbook as an Amazon Kindle format on Amazon.CONS:- Amazon Kindle is making impossible to save a PDF copy of the book for Amazon's silly DRM policies. However, scientific textbooks would read better as PDFs instead of a Kindle format. Really disappointed how CRC Press (headed by Taylor & Francis press) has decided to rely on Amazon Kindle. For the record, Cambridge University Press is adopting the same DRM protected policy, unfortunately. DRM policies clearly are blocking scientific research. The choice of selling a DRM protected textbook sounds awkward since the first author (Osvaldo Martin) has published his previous textbook in 2016 (""Bayesian analysis with Python"") with Packt press. At Packt they are brave enough to offer DRM-free material. Why Mr Martin has changed his mind in his second textbook?- The formulas are poorly written (mathematically correct, but the style is bad). They need to be rewritten in LaTeX. Perhaps the hardcover version is better. I did not check it.PRO:- The textbook successfully delivers the promises of the first textbook from 2016: very intuitive explanations of complex statistical concepts; few mathematical formulas; lots of concrete examples; gorgeous plots;- it is worth mentioning the useful accompanying site (https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/) where you can find plenty of well written Python code about the plots and analyses presented in the book;CONCLUSION:In terms of ""entry level"" Bayesian modeling, I think this textbook (Martin et al. 2022, ""Bayesian Modeling and computation in python"") and McElreath's textbook (Richard McElreath 2020 ""Statistical rethinking"") are the best ones out there.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)

The coverage of self-attention is one paragraph, including two formulas.  If you understand transformers, do you think 8 pages is enough for a clear introduction to the subject?The chapter on variational autoencoders is 15 pages, contains 60 formulas, about 60 references to the literature, and 5 figures.  I don't find the figures very helpful.  Also, 15 pages on variational autoencoders but only 20 pages on convolutional networks?Some things I like about the book include the topic coverage, the citations to the literature, and that some interesting applications of deep learning are discussed.  I will probably find the book useful for reference and for citations to the literature.I use Chollet's Deep Learning with Python and Geron's Hands-on Machine learning book in my classes and I think these are good choices for most people who are new to deep learning.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Science of Deep Learning

"This is mostly a good introductory book. Especially useful since there is a bit of a dearth on Tensorflow 2.x books out there.  One thing I was interested in and was how to import keras and bring in datasets.  So far I have gotten most of the way through Chapter 1.  Disturbingly, on the IMDB example there are errors in the code.  It can be fairly straightforward to fix them.  One was in the statements to import the IMDB database.  It is like the author thought of implementing the code one way, changed their mind and didn't check it out.  I assume this happens later in the book too.  I have coded a fair amount in tensorflow1.x and have been looking for a good book on tensorflow2.x.  So here I am.  I wanted one that also explored how keras was integrated into tensorflow.  I know there is a script to convert files but I was worried the process would not be overly transparent, so I wanted to type in the examples myself.  So far I am glad I went this route.  Tensorflow2.x seems a vast improvement and is much easier to follow and this is evident in the code examples I have read and implemented so far in chapter 1.  I don't mind so errors, just not too many.  I think of correcting them as a form of homework.Since I am using it to self study and get up to speed on Tensorflow2.x I am happy so far.  If my opinion changes as I get further into the book, I will update this review.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 and Keras: Regression ConvNets GANs RNNs NLP and more with TensorFlow 2 and the Keras API 2nd Edition
"As a deep learning practitioner in the computer vision space, I found the academic content in Chapter 8 RNNs, Ch. 9 AutoEncoders, Ch. 11 Reinforcement Learning, Ch. 15 The Math behind Deep Learning and Ch. 12 TFX to be most useful. Of course, the other chapters are useful as well, and do tie into the ones I just mentioned. But as a professional in the field of machine learning, I got the most lift in the chapters I mentioned above. These topics will help you get a data science job or develop your current skill set if you’re already in the field:RNNs: Excellent review for those of us that work with them, and it does touch on some advanced topics like transformers, which are SOTA as of 2020.Reinforcement Learning: It goes into depth on Q-Networks and deep deterministic gradient policies, so a data scientist will understand these better when implementing from outside code tutorial -- very useful for this.Auto Encoders: Lots of business use cases can take advantage of these, so I recommend taking the time to learn this, and code them out.Math Behind Deep Learning: More for beginners entering the deep learning field, however, for experienced data scientists it wouldn't hurt to go over derivatives, differentiation, chain rule and backpropagation.TFX: A little light, it’s more of a detailed outline, I wish there was a docker-compose and coding example on how to set it up and connect TFX Pipe to TF/Keras models.

"If you're hoping to use TensorFlow 2.0 for deep learning projects, this book is an excellent resource.  The topics are developed clearly and in sufficient detail to allow one to master them with minimal effort, and the range of topics covered is exceptional.  As a TA for both undergraduate and graduate AI and ML courses, I'll be using this book frequently, not only for my own work, but also to help students to get a running start on their course projects. This is the single best resource I've found, and is not only a great way to learn new techniques, but also as a resource to quickly refresh one's memory on topics when one needs a quick reminder, or some starter code for a new project. Tensorflow 2.0, with its emphasis on Keras, is a framework that will likely gain an increasing share of the DL framework market, and one won't find a clearer exposition than this book.

"I was new to machine learning when I tried to read this textbook. I think it would be better suited for someone who has already been studying machine learning for a while. I have a lot of python experience though, so that made things a little easier. I like that it tries to cover a ton of different things. The best thing about this book is that it covers a wide range of topics. But I feel like each topic in the book is explained very quickly. I had a lot of questions about each topic and had to Google a lot of stuff while reading it. It wasn't always clear why they were adding the layers that they were adding to the model. Or what the advantages and disadvantages of doing it that way was. If this book was a class, I probably wouldn't do so well on the final. Maybe someday I will get good enough at machine learning to be able to help the authors edit and improve the book.

"The thorough and enlightening book ""Deep Learning with Vision Systems"" explores the intriguing area of deep learning and its uses in the field of computer vision. The complex terrain of integrating cutting-edge machine learning methods with visual data interpretation is skilfully negotiated in this book.Complex subjects are made understandable for both newcomers and seasoned practitioners by the author's straightforward and succinct explanations. Each chapter is methodically organised, laying a strong basis before tackling more complex subjects. The case studies and real-world examples explain how deep learning techniques may be used to address a variety of visual identification problems and give a practical context.The book's emphasis on practical learning stands out as one of its significant advantages. The readers are given the tools to put the ideas addressed into practise through the use of hands-on exercises and code examples, frequently utilising well-known frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This participatory method improves comprehension and guarantees that readers can use their information successfully.Although the book admirably covers a wide range of subjects, there are times when the breadth of coverage can leave some readers longing for more in-depth analyses of particular subdomains. However, the book offers a comprehensive understanding of deep learning in vision systems and is a good place to start.\The book is a useful addition to your library whether you're a student, researcher, or industry expert because of its practical approach and thorough information.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Vision Systems

I was taking class on ""ML for vision"", and this book is a godsend for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Vision Systems
"I can compare this one to ""Deep Learning"" by Ian Goodfellow. I've been working as a deep-learning engineer for last 5 years.  I would say this is a great book to kickstart a career in a modern ML / Computer Vision domain. Compared to Goodfellow, it's way more practical in terms of what you need to know to actually build a good a model from scratch. It doesn't go into a deep math background. It doesn't cover 101 research branches that were undertaken in last 20 years but ended up not working in a field. It solely focuses on what exactly is being used in industry these days.On the cons side, I think, to be a good CV engineer there should be a pre-requisite to this book: a more classic computer vision course. So the reader has a better understanding where all those DL techniques should be put in a more broad CV world.Bottomline: Great tutorial. Very easy to digest and get really excited about deep learning.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Vision Systems

"The content of this book is really good; it doesn't go too deep, but it covers the basics fairly well; the pace is adequate if you have some basic knowledge of Deep Learning and are just getting started on Computer Vision.I bought it directly from Manning since there was a flash deal and got it for half the price; however, I soon regretted this decision; their shipping costs are slightly cheaper than Amazon, but their shipping and customer service are THE WORST; long story short, the book arrived one month later, and the customer service didn't provide me any solutions in the meantime, stating that I had to wait up to two months for the book to arrive... this is ridiculous, there are companies that ship from halfway across the world and deliver their goods for cents in no more than one month.Moral of the story: don't fall for Manning's deals and buy from Amazon instead.Happy learning!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Vision Systems
"As a mathematician, I enjoyed this book. Plenty of ‘hands-on’ introductions to deep learning are available, and they have their use and place. I started that way.

"This is a wonderful and rather unique book on deep learning (DL) in production. In contrast to most available books on machine learning (ML) that cover mostly theory and/or model training, this book focuses on real-world aspects of model deployment and DL pipelines in production. It covers a variety of important (and often neglected) topics, including data preparation, model management and experiment tracking (with W&B and DVC), as well as production-related topics such as model deployment and monitoring in cloud (AWS) and mobile (iOS and Android) environments. Deep learning frameworks covered include both PyTorch and TensorFlow.I can imagine two main audiences that will benefit the most from this book: software engineers that will learn how to apply their knowledge to build AI-focused applications, and machine learning practitioners and data scientists that will learn what it takes to productionize their models and turn them into customer-facing applications.While this book should probably not be your first experience with DL, if you already have some knowledge on DL or are a software engineer focusing on DL in production, this book will take your knowledge to the next level and make you a better DL practitioner, well-versed in the different aspects of DL in production.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Production-Ready Applied Deep Learning: Learn how to construct and deploy complex models in PyTorch and TensorFlow deep learning frameworks

The focus on relevant tools (AWS, PyTorch, Tensorflow, SageMaker, W&B, MLFlow, Kubernetes, ONNX, etc.) is really good.

"The book is a good introduction book for learning the production steps of deep learning. The book helps a beginner to understand various available frameworks for deploying deep learning models.

The explainable AI section at the end of part 2 could have been presented better. Part 3, deployment and maintenance, helps beginners to get an overall idea of Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and Elastic Kubernetes Services. However, certain sections of the chapter could have been better. For example, chapter 11, Deep Learning on Mobile Devices, doesn't explain the detailed steps to deploy the model on iOS and Android apps.

"The authors are definitely ambitious: >300 pages jam packed with content. I like how all the authors are out there working in industry - that gives this work credibility (and kudos for sharing a PDF with all the figures and charts). This book hits the right spot with a huge push for MLOps but very few resources to learn about it; great how 5 of the 13 chapters (38%) deal with deployment. A bit surprising so little time (only two chapters) deal with data preparation, but at least one of those is the useful Data Preparation in the Cloud. The problem with such a large book is that it can feel exhausting wading through it all. At times it feels more like a reference book rather than a teaching textbook. In my opinion this book is targeted to people already in the deep learning space and not those with ""beginner-level knowledge in machine learning or software engineering"" as the preface claims.

"This is a very nice book.  I am looking at it to learn what generative models are, and I am specifically interested in the use case of predicting protein structure.  The book hits the spot in introducing me to both of these topics.The first chapter explains the difference between generative models and models that are more common such as linear and logistic regression.  In the case of generative models, rather than using a fitted formula to predict an output, we either 1) sample from (x, y) or 2) we start with a target y, and sample the x.  There  are several types of generative models: Naive Bayes Classifiers, Gaussian Mixture Models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models, Hidden Markov Models, Deep Boltzmann Machines, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  The last three of these types are deep neural network models.The second chapter goes through, in careful detail, setting up a programming environment which provides a foundation for reproducible applications.  TensorFlow and Keras are used due to their widespread usage. Interesting background on TensorFlow is provided.  The setup for programming includes: open source code editor, VSCode, as IDE, Docker for creating a reproducible Python ""execution environment"" (Python language version and libraries), Kubernetes for managing applications with multiple containers  (each container could be responsible for a different task), Kubeflow built on top of Kubernetes has several components useful in the ""end-to-end process of managing ML applications"", Katib - a utility built into Kubeflow enables optimizing models for parameter grids, Jupyter Notebooks can be started in a namespace using Kubeflow, Kubeflow can be deployed on AWS, Azure, and GCP, and Terraform is a template language whose instructions can be used to install Kubeflow on any of the cloud platforms.It is a long list, but each piece provides something useful.Chapter 3 covers the ""building blocks of deep neural networks"" to help understand the theory behind the code.  This is a valuable chapter to build an understanding of the progression from perceptrons to multi-layer perceptrons and backpropagation.  Backpropagation is described, including with math formulas.Different types of networks are described: convolution, recursive, and networks for sequence data.  Also, there is a section on ""building a better optimizer"".  There is a long list of useful references with links, at the  end of the chapter, including some papers by Hinton.The next 10 chapters cover use cases, with code blocks: generating digits, painting pictures, generating images, creating deep fakes and transferring styles (like replacing one person's face with another's, converting a horse into a zebra, creating a painting from a photo), generating text, composing music, playing video games, and emerging applications, such as finding new drugs, predicting protein structure, solving PDEs, creating videos from images, and generating food recipes.For the two drug applications described in the last chapter, it is a short section with no code, though, the reader is referred back to earlier chapters where there is code for a model type.  The writing is very to the point, with excellent diagrams to provide an understanding of the problem and the approach.  The list of references at the end of the last chapter, Emerging Applications, includes a link to the DeepMind blog entry for AlphaFold: Using AI for scientific discovery (i.e. protein folding).The book clearly and carefully covers a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"The main things I really loved about this book are the code and Chapter 6. Chapter 6 gives an excellent framework for how to compare the various flavors of generative models and GANs and abstracts them away in a common architecture so I now feel like it would be pretty easy to learn about a new GAN architecture. The code on Github makes this even easier because you can just pull in the repo in a Google collab notebook and see for yourself how everything works. https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Generative-AI-with-Python-and-TensorFlow-2The main weakness this book has is it ends up repeating lots of content like for e.g the basic code for discriminators and generators or explaining way too many things that aren't really essential to understanding generative models like a comprehensive overview of neural networks or cloud deployments with Terraform and on Google, AWS and Azure etc.. which detract away from how clear chapters like chapter 6 are.As far as the examples go, the NLP section is weak relative to the audio and image sections with the image sections definitely being the star of the show.All the content that's not Generative modeling focused may still be valuable if this is the first deep learning book you've bought but if it's not and you're really buying this to learn more about GANs and friends then you can read Chapter 1, 6 and 9 and skim the rest.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"This book covers the most advanced explicit density based generative models (RBM, VAE, etc.) and implicit density based generative models (GAN, etc.).  It also gives detailed tutorials on using Keras, the most popular deep learning tool, to build these models. In particular, it also shows how to distribute large-scale deep learning models on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cloud servers (e.g., AWS). This is very essential for model training such as GAN that has huge number of parameters as well as a large number of image samples.In the first chapter, the authors introduced the basic concepts of generative models and discriminative models. They clarified the difference by introducing the Bayes probability model behind them. It helped reader sort out the general discriminant models (linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, etc.), and know how generative model works. They also introduced the different types of generative models and their applications. This chapter is very important to the beginners.In the second chapter, the authors gave a detailed tutorial to build the development environment. However, the build environment of this book is based on MacOS (this should have been mentioned), but according to my experience, many people in industry and especially academic use Linux.In the third chapter, the authors briefly reviewed the build blocks of the deep learning models including, perceptrons, hidden layers, loss function, activate function,optmizer, etc. These are all essential components for a deep neural network. Even most of them are build-in components in the recent AI packages, but understanding them can help  the developers know deeper about their networks.The rest of the chapters talked about different types of generative models from  Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), to NLP and reinforce learning generative models. For each model, the author always first gave the mathematical description, and then showed the implementation process. I think understanding the theory behind each model is critical for practical using. There is a little thing can be improved when describing the math explanation. Some symbols in the formula and text are inconsistent, for example the epsilon and e.Among all the generative models in the book, the GAN family attracts me the most. The author introduced the development process from vanilla GAN, conditional GAN ​​to progressive GAN. They also taught two of the most exciting applications of GAN: style transfer and face transfer (deep fake). At the end of each part, they also discussed the challenges and potential research direction of the each generative model. In summary, this is a good manual for the people of deep learning in industry and academia.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"Generative models learn a distribution of data for a given class, as opposed to Discriminative models, which learn the probability of a class given the data. When we talk of models in Machine Learning, we are generally talking about Discriminative models. However, of late, Generative models have become easier to create, and the ability to create and use them are becoming an essential skill for most ML practitioners. This book is therefore not only very timely, it also provides a very comprehensive coverage about popular types of Generative models, mostly in the area of Computer Vision (CV), but Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) use cases are covered as well. Models covered in the CV area are Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In the NLP area, coverage includes pre-Transformer (RNN, Language Models) and post-Transformer (Autoregressive models such as GPT-2 and GPT-3) models. Application in the RL area is also explored, where a Generative model can be used as the world-model or Environment which takes a state action pair and generates a new action. There is also a chapter on novel applications of Generative models, such as generating novel molecular structures, protein folding, etc.Overall, this book provides a very comprehensive and in-depth coverage of Generative models. At the same time, unlike other books that cover this subject, the book does not demand a skill/knowledge threshold from its readers. As a result, it can appear wordy at times. Code examples are in Tensorflow, but since the authors use Tensorflow 2, Pytorch users will be able to follow along quite easily as well.DISCLAIMER: I was asked by the publisher if I would like to review the book, and I was provided with a free copy of the book when I agreed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"About This BookThis book covers image generation, deepfakes, composing music, and much more. It begins with the basic knowledge required, moves on to setting up your system, gives you the foundation of the field, and then covers a wide range of applications.Who Is This For?This book is for anyone who is interested in generating creative works using AI techniques. It’s a great way to learn how to fight against deepfakes, generate text, or create photorealistic images of people who do not exist. It’s an interesting application of AI that is improving at a vast rate.OrganizationThe macrostructure of the book is set up well. There are no high-order groupings of the chapters, which is a minor loss, but the skills you need to accomplish the projects later in the book are built up earlier. Each chapter covers its topic well, summarizes what you read, and then gives all of the chapters’ references. Overall, a good organization.Did This Book Succeed?If you work through this book from beginning to end, or at least the foundational chapters and the application chapters you’re interested in, you will get a LOT out of this book. I have no doubt that you will then be able to work through recent research papers, deconstruct open source applications, or create your own AI-enabled art.Rating and Final ThoughtsOverall, I give this book a 5 out of 5.This is a great book to add to your personal AI library, even if it’s not your area of focus. Just makes sure to do the projects and extend them to make sure you comprehend the material. There is much to learn here, so don’t miss out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"This book is for self-motivated learners who are willing to do the examples. This is a “doing” book! Fork the GitHub. Setup your Dev environment. Run the exercises. Experiment. Use a dataset that you know. Then, move to next chapter. Your effort will be rewarded with a practical skill-set that you can demo to colleagues in exciting new (generative) ways.You should be at an immediate-level with Machine Learning concepts and Python-related skills. A few beginning ML courses (or equivalent) are sufficient. Knowing a bit about TF/Keras or PyTorch is helpful.I ditto the previous review by HawkInFlight, which has a nice summary of the topics of the early chapters. In these chapters, the authors cover an incredible diversity, both in ML tech (VAE to GAN and back again!) and in dataset modes (handwritten digits, images, style transfer, deep-fakes, text gen, music, video).I was particularly impressed by how the first three chapters eases the learner into executing code in Chapter 4 on MNIST images. So, pay attention to these chapters! Revisit as needed.The first chapter is a gentle intro into Bayes Theorem that forms the concept basis for discriminative versus generative learning. Nice twist on the usual contrast between supervised versus un(self)-supervised learning.The second chapter packs lot into sketching a full cloud-base ML development environment, complete with… TF2, Keras, VSCode, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, AWS+GCP+Azure, Teraform. Go Docker!!! …although there was no mention of Colab on GCP. The GitHub code for the book is elegant and well organized.

"A few years ago, I was fascinated by Generative AI while reading Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet. The book was not about generative AI, and only 1 chapter was devoted to a high-level view and some great examples.Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2 goes into a deeper dive with Generative AI, starting with controlling a fleet of servers to a fast crash course in Deep Neural Networks. By Chapter 4, you're already generating data, which is mostly text. The explanations of each subject are fantastic, and I'm deeply grateful for all the graphics the authors provided to explain. I don't work with matrices daily, so I find the formulas very useful.I'm still going through the book, but there was one particular reason I was interested in it. Chapter 11 is about Music Generation, which is another part I find fascinating. While it's mostly an explanation of different models to analyze music, I find that I was looking for just that. - If you're looking to get started with Generating things with Generative AI, this is a great place to start. - If you're a seasoned AI generator, the main advantage of this book is using Tensorflow 2 for its examples, but you probably already saw this material from other places.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"This book does an excellent job of covering a very large number of relevant topics in the area of generative models, with focus on deep-learning based models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The authors guide the reader from the basics of deep-learning and GANs, all the way to advanced and exotic applications such as drug discovery, music generation and PDE solving using GANs, as well as a detailed survey of deep-fakes, their technical challenges, implications, and ethical issues. Topics are explained in detail but kept quite accessible, making this a great reference for beginners as well as seasoned deep-learning practitioners. Discussions are almost always followed by a hands-on section, where Python code snippets are provided to illustrate how specific solutions can be implemented in TensorFlow (the authors use the Keras API, which greatly improves readability of TensorFlow code). The only small flaw I can point out is that several equations throughout the book are printed as low-def images, which is a bit unsightly. This does not compromise readability, though, and I hope it gets fixed in future editions.

There are coding examples for every chapter, thus making this book very practical to use.It is an ambitious book. It tries to cover many different domains of AI, starting with introduction to neural networks, ending with deep reinforcement learning. The weaker part is in reinforcement learning, which is not necessarily needed for this book.In general, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning GAN and VAE, the two most important generative models in AI today.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models

"While Python normally does the job just fine when it comes to handling ML and more general analytics tasks, I have wanted for a long time to work on these kinds of problems using C++.  Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to get started because of a severe lack of educational resources out there.  Luckily, this book has finally filled that gap for me.What I really like about the book is that the author has put together a series of very complete examples for each method being discussed.  Every program reads in an actual csv file with the data (as opposed to using some form of random number generation to create a toy example), puts it into the right format to be used with the given implementation of an ML method and then puts together a data set that one can use as output.  As someone who has not had much experience with C++ outside a classroom setting, I found this extremely helpful, and it has made the material immediately applicable to my work in real life.The book covers just the right amount of theory in each chapter as well before diving into the C++ implementation, making the material accessible to developers who are relatively new to data science (which, as I understand, is actually the main target audience).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Machine Learning with C++: Build train and deploy end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipelines

It has the same  mathematical introduction theory, but counters with a set of code libraries that work with C++.This book will allow the C++ programmer to expand his programming scope without having to rewrite his entire code base in Python and learn a whole new programming language.

"I originally bought this book with the hopes of being able to get a better grasp on machine learning with c++, since the back cover states: ""This book makes machine learning with C++ for beginners easy with its example based approach"". It starts off reviewing some of the basics of linear algebra... OK. But then in the next chapter, in an attempt to get you familiar with all of the different libraries, you begin loading data using API's without any background to what those API's do and then how you would use that data.The author tries to familiarize you with a bunch of different libraries, without truly ever really describing the details of any of them. The author will write code to accomplish a task with a given library, and then repeat the same with another library. But, in my opinion, this is done without much insight as to why you are doing what you are doing. Just copying code.The background info on neural networks, although helpful, does not really explain fully how they work, outside of providing the differential equations that are implemented.It is a really tough read to go from cover to cover, and I don't feel like you really grasp much, since too much is trying to be explained with a bunch of tools, but no focus on any given tool.I think it would be much better if someone were to focus on one or two tools (xtensor, libtorch, dlib, etc) and approach the subject in that manner. This way, you are familiarizing yourself with the subject as well as the library you are using",2.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Machine Learning with C++: Build train and deploy end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipelines
"Disclaimer: The publisher asked me to review this book and gave me a review copy. I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.Personal Background: My first programming language after I started university was C++, followed by C. I'm glad to see that C++ can be used for ML problems, though I do understand that Python can be the easier choice. I try to keep in mind, however, that most if not all Python ML libraries are written in C/C++ to make it run faster.OverviewTo get the most out of this book, I would recommend that you have at least an intermediate competency of C++ and some basic knowledge of machine learning. The former is far more valuable than the later, in this case, as the author assumes that you know C++. There is no hand holding with the code. However, the author does walk you through ML from the basics to a moderate level.What I Like:This book is broken into four overall sections: Overview of Machine Learning, Machine Learning Algorithms, Advanced Examples, and Production and Deployment Challenges. This is an excellent selection of sections that make the overall book better organized. The first section gives a good overview of machine learning (as the title indicates), including a basic understanding of the math involved, data preproccessing, and general rundown of the considerations for choosing which ML technique you should use.The second section gives all the major ML algorithms that a junior ML developer will need. The book focuses on supervised and unsupervised ML, which is most of what you'll see in a business setting. This section finishes with a chapter on Ensemble Learning, where you use multiple ML algorithms to give you better results. The advanced examples mix and match some other algorithms to give you a basic understanding and a starting point for learning more. The final section looks at model deployment and mobile and cloud considerations. If you're new to machine learning and wish to use C++, this is a book book for it. Especially valuable are the Further Reading sections at the end of every chapter.What I Don't Like:When looking at the code, it was very different from the C++ code I learn nearly two decades ago. With the use of C++17, I faced a steep learning curve to use the code examples. While not a concern in and of itself, the first reference to C++17 I could find is on page 41. As someone who knows and enjoys an older version, this made using the code examples more difficult to me. I understand and agree with using a more recent version of the language, but would have appreciated a warning on the back cover or at least in the preface so that I could do some review first. A book recommendation for learning this version of C++ would have be appreciated as well.In the first chapter, the author divides machine learning up into two categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. While technically correct, there is a third category that doesn't fit well into either one: reinforcement learning. I wouldn't expect the author to delve into that niche sub field, it still should have been mentioned.What I Would Like to See:I really enjoyed this book. It has much to offer anyone with C++ experience. It is well organized and has much useful information. I am very happy to have it as part of my library. I think that a book from this author about C++ ML from Scratch would be interesting.Overall, I give this book a 4.9 out of 5.

"About This BookThis book is the latest in a collection of attempts to teach aspiring and experience machine learning practitioners the mathematics underlying their field. Knowing this will help anyone truly understand how their algorithms work in more detail and can assist in strengthening their predictions or troubleshooting when the results don't match up.It begins with the basics of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics, moves on to optimization and graph theory, and then digs deeper into more specific mathematics. The second section takes the foundation and looks at different kinds of simpler neural networks. The final section pushes even further into deep learning and makes sure that the reader can explain why their deep learning models do what they do.Who is This For?From the Preface, this book is for anyone who wants to go from the basic mathematical concepts to the exact mathematical structures used in calculating the results for deep learning. It does not expect the reader to know the math, though it would be helpful, but it does expect the reader to know the basics of how machine learning works.With how difficult most people find mathematics, I know that many machine learning practitioners won't want to delve deep into these fundamentals, if they even are curious at all. But every field has a foundation, and I would argue that mathematics is that foundation for machine learning. After all, machine learning is fundamentally a mathematically transformation of the input to the output.Why Was This Written?There are only a handful of books written on this subject, of which I own most of them. Most focus only on the basics of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. Another perspective on comparing these books is the approach taken. I can think of only one other book written specifically for the mathematics of deep learning, and that one assumes the reader thinks more like a mathematician. This book, instead, sees the reader as a developer with hands on experience who wants to know why their algorithms work. I feel that this is an important contribution to anyone's collection.OrganizationThree three section organization works well here. The author progresses from the basics to the core subject matter indicated by the title of the book without leaving anything important out. Remember, this book isn't about learning everything about these mathematical subjects, but about knowing enough to better understand deep learning. You're aren't going to focus on proving that the math works, but will trust that the math works and apply it.Within each chapter, the author deftly introduces each topic, builds on the subject from the basics up to the more advanced subtopics you should know about, and then gives a summary to refresh the earlier material and bring it all together. There is a complete preface, which I recommend you read through before starting, and a further reading section with other offerings from the publisher on deep learning.Did This Book Succeed?I think the author did very well. It gives the reader all of the mathematics they will need to progress on their machine learning and deep learning journeys. Where I think this book fell short, as it is written for practitioners, is that it could have expanded by another 100-150 pages and added in code to show how a programming language can efficiently calculate the math. This could help the reader write better code. If the author decides to write a second edition, I hope that they will consider this.Rating and Final ThoughtsI give this book a 5 out of 5. It is complete, readable, and helpful. It does what it says it is going to do very well. I commend the author and hope to see more from them.

"If you have seen one of Lopez de Prado's lectures, you will understand immediately that his work offers advances to standard problems in portfolio management. This small book summarizes the main contributions and cannot be recommended strongly enough.The book is comprised of several very dense chapters of all new material in the field. These include advances in covariance estimation based on random matrix theory, optimal clustering, labelling methods for trend tracking, using ML for variable selection for prediction, hierarchical risk parity (instead of Markowitz portfolio optimization) for portfolio selection, and two alternatives to standard sharpe-ratio back testing of strategies. All of these new methodologies address fundamental problems with the standard techniques that have been used for decades in portfolio theory and in sum represent a big step forward in the theory.This book is worth purchasing just to read the introduction. It gives great insight into how to use machine learning for finance that you won't find in any other book.The author devised a machine learning algorithm based on 'theories' of finance 'discovered' from machine learning, not based on back testing. This made all the difference during the flash crash. Unlike many others, his algorithm made lots of money during this period because of the way he designed it.This book will NOT teach you general machine learning techniques.

"Marcos has brought attention to a number of interesting analysis techniques in the recent years.His previous book, Advances in Financial Machine Learning, was much more broad/technical in scope.  I enjoyed this text because it is much more concise and lays out a clear entry point into purely data-driven investing.The book begins by outlining a powerful and intuitive technique which can be used to de-noise correlation matrices.  Marcos provides strong validation for this methodology with stylized Monte Carlo.Using MC in this way is an innovative idea  -- one which the physics community has embraced for decades.  In particle physics we rely on Monte Carlo to remove reliance on empirically collected data and to validate our understanding.  Applying this approach to finance is sure to bear fruit by bringing more objectivity to finance in the coming years.The book continues on in a similar manner to outline more clear and simple techniques which can yield similarly objective results.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Elements in Quantitative Finance)
"Interesting, not because it contains new mathematical developments or ideas (most of the clustering related content is between 10 to 20 years old; same for the random matrix theory (RMT) part, which is already applied in many hedge funds and other sophisticated asset managers), but because all these existing ideas and methods (prevalent in the industry or in (some part of, e.g. econophysics rather than finance) academia) are, maybe for the first time, exposed clearly and linearly throughout the book. You may find RMT experts, clustering experts, optimizers in chief, and various frameworks to deal with multiple testing biases, but rarely all this knowledge is brought together in one place with a consistent presentation and set of notations. Marcos has achieved this, by clearly exposing all these elements (if not the most recent sophistications).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Elements in Quantitative Finance)

"It's great that someone's written a book about Feature Engineering and it contains a lot of interesting material. I also like that clear readable coding examples are included (Python), so that the reader can try at home.But, it feels unfinished. The book is pretty short and the set of topics seems more like what the authors were interested in than a survey of the field. The level of explanation varies from super-detailed to glossing over concepts and technical terms that most readers won't know.The biggest issue is that the graphics are mostly hand-drawn on some kind of tablet and look like they were scrawled out quickly.

"At the end of the preview, the book recommends converting song listening counts into  a binary 0 1 variable. This is TERRIBLE advice. It mentions binning as an alternative but goes ahead with binary code. The authors argument is that ""listening 10 times does not mean liking the song as much as someone who listens ,,20 times.""In other words, if the user listened to a song at least once, then we count it as the user liking the song. This way, the model will not need to spend cycles on predicting the minute differences between the raw counts. The binary target is a simple and robust measure of user preference."".  There are many ways to deal with possible non-proportional effects. Going to a 1 treats someone who tried a song and did not like it the same as someone who listens daily!I would love a good book on this topic for my students, but this is not it..",2.0 out of 5 stars,Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists

"AWS can be a whirling dervish of expanding services and new features for professionals and people just starting their careers. So let's break this down to a simple question.Why is this book worth your money and lifetime?The book provides accessible hands on updates to the labs/workshops from the first edition and has expanded architectural analysis of different implementations and lessons learned. If you are completely unfamiliar or lightly familiar with the subject matter, the labs/workshops will give you the hands on ability to both engage the material and consider directions and design choices made by others in a tone that does not come off as 'carved in stone'. But wait you say, I'm an experienced professional! What more do I have to learn? Go back to my opening statement, AWS is constantly changing and the book provides experienced views of implementations and lessons learned, sometimes we can avoid a mistake by learning about how others thoughtfully made it.What is the book missing?It would have been great to have additional detail or an appendix regarding metrics and key points of interest that were being tracked which led to architecture and implementation shifts in the use cases. What was done and how would the authors approach the same architecture/engineering issues today?Expanding cost analysis in appendix B, I understand that cost analysis is really dry material but a critical factor of success is understanding cost patterns and building muscle to recognize and remediate inefficiencies.I enjoyed this book so much, I even bought access to the 2ed edition when it was a work in progress at Manning. The updated labs/workshops helped to enforce the concepts and ideas, I still consider the material both educational and even entertaining. Peter's work was quite good in the first edition, inputs from Yan and Ajay seem to have made the second edition even better.I hope this review helps and with you the best of luck.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Serverless Architectures on AWS Second Edition

What about the specific ""Pythonic way"" every advanced Python programmer should learn about? Nothing here.It is extremely verbose, considering the whole book has just a few lines of actual code. It's also very pretentious, and you may get tired of that style ""with an attitude"": we're not all in high-school, and this guy is not our teacher.It's also basically for Linux, and if you're a Mac or Windows guy, not very useful. Most Python books are OS-independent.A full chapter is dedicated to writing SIMPLE SQL database statements. I agree any programmer should know something about this, but did you buy the book to waste your time on such simple use cases as those presented here?Finally, this looks more like a book of homework assignments, but for some pretty large projects (many of them). Do you really have time to practice on such large projects? Or are they really necessary, with such a huge waste of time, just to become more advanced in Python?

"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence have taken the world by storm and revolutionized entire fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Building effective ML models requires choosing first and foremost the right architecture, and an essential part of this process is choosing an optimal or near-optimal set of hyperparameters. Due to the somewhat mechanical nature of hyperparameter optimization, its importance is often underestimated by academics and practitioners alike.This unique book serves as a comprehensive guide to hyperparameter optimization. It begins with an introduction to hyperparameter tuning, and describes the main techniques involved: exhaustive search, heuristic search, Bayesian optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. The second part of the book provides a practical and helpful overview of the top relevant frameworks, such as scikit-learn, Hyperopt, Optuna, NNI and DEAP. The associated GitHub repository includes a useful collection of Colab Notebooks to demonstrate the implementation of the presented techniques.This practical book will benefit ML researchers, data scientists and software engineers who build and train ML models. It requires no more than a basic understanding of ML and some familiarity with the Python programming language. In return, the reader will gain a thorough understanding of one of the more important and underappreciated aspects of training ML models - hyperparameter tuning.Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hyperparameter Tuning with Python: Boost your machine learning models performance via hyperparameter tuning

"I took a stats class early in my college career and tanked it miserably. I was convinced from that point on that statistics just was not my thing and never really would be. Fast forward to my current classes where an introductory stats was part of the curriculum in the form of quantitative research and I was in fear of my current goals going down the tubes. When the required text for this class arrived, I opened it tentatively and was surprised to find that it didn’t read like it was written by a computer program. Very understandable and human breakdowns interlaced with practice and exercises designed to break down complex ideas in simple terms. It will take work for people who struggle, this book is good but it isn’t a miracle but it is done in a way that is doable. It helps if you have access to a program like SPSS as well to be able to follow along with it. I felt like statistics was something that I wouldn’t fully understand but this book has helped immensely just by being relatable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics for People Who (Think They) Hate Statistics

"There are a lot of good things about this new book. First, this is a very good authoring team. They have a deep (both correct and very  up-to-date) understanding that spans the technical aspects of data analytics, and how and why analytics is used in business settings to make business oriented decisions. Second, the book is well crafted. It is very well organized with very clear and to-the-point explanations. Of the five authors of this book, three of them (Shmueli, Bruce and Patel) have been together as a text writing team since 2007, and this is the 5th time they have updated and revised their business analytics text based on new developments in the field, and based on ongoing feedback from faculty and students who have used the text in both academic courses and professional training courses. Third, because this team has been deeply involved in data analytics for decades, they have a good sense of perspective. They understand the history and evolution of models from the statistics community, as well as the history and evolution of models from computing communities spanning both data mining and machine learning. The lead author, Galit Shmueli, has been publishing in both the statistics literature as well as the management science literature on the differences between explanation (and inference) versus prediction. This depth of perspective, and technically correct understanding of these important nuances, are reflected in how the material in this book is organized and presented. Fourth, they provide a unified and coherent approach to understanding these models.  They have major sections on classification models and prediction models. They also have sections on time series forecasting, association models, and clustering. In each of these sections on model and application specifics, they draw on the appropriate models from across the communities of statistics, data mining and machine learning. In addition, the book contains sections on the front end (data prep, exploration, and dimension reduction), as well as on the backend of the modelling process (model evaluation). All examples are worked out in R.The specific chapters on each data analytics modeling method are relatively short and to-the-point, as there are numerous textbooks and professional books on every one of the individual methods covered in this text. Because these authors are now in their fifth iteration of the content, and because they get a lot of feedback on what users of this material do and do not clearly understand, this authoring team has a knack for adding special explanatory material for those things that people tend to not understand well, or often misunderstand. While the chapters on each method are by design brief and introductory, they are solidly sufficient and highly informative, even for people with prior background in these methods. They have a good way of knowing what is important to explain, and a good way of explaining what they present.In short, this is an excellent introductory text and also serves as a very good reference text for the most up-to-date thinking on the the modeling that underpins  business analytics.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts Techniques and Applications in R

"This is one of a handful of books on ML and R, and it’s by far the simplest in its coverage of content. For instance, it’s the only one I’ve looked at so far that has explained the difference between the Naive Bayes and Exact Bayes algorithms, although I haven’t looked at the Manning books on ML (e.g., Practical Data Science with R) some of which use R and some Python (e.g., Real-World Machine Learning). By a kindergarten approach to ML, I don’t mean to be disrespectful or to minimize the contribution of the book—presenting a topic at a simple basic level is worthwhile. The reasons I downgraded the book slightly were the large number of errors in the book (which look like material from previous editions that wasn’t caught) and some carelessness in what is presented. For some reason, in the chapter entitled “Overview of the Data Mining Process,” it bothered me a lot that the authors detail creation of dummy variables but don’t present factor variables until halfway through the book. Perhaps that was just the desire to present things at a basic level, however. I did learn some R functions I wasn’t familiar with from this book, and it does provide clear, explicit explanations of ML (or data mining) techniques. (For the life of me, I still don’t have a clear understanding of the differences between ML, data science, data analytics, and data mining—I suspect it is how the techniques and data are used that determines the difference, because the same techniques are used in all of these disciplines.)

"As a math teacher for 25 years, I have seen a lot of books that attempt to explain introductory statistics.  This new book by veteran teacher and math writer Pat Honner is the best book I have seen of this type.  What is so great about this book is that Honner takes a topic like statistics that can be very dry with many formulas and he weaves a story about the power and limitations of different statistical techniques.  Beginning with simple statistics in the early chapters that could be read by even middle school students, this book progresses until, by the end, it would be a great book for a college student who is taking introductory statistics and wants to get the big picture and a lot of detail about solving very specific questions in statistics.  The last few chapters cover a topic that is very difficult to teach without getting bogged down in formulas, but Honner does just that.  This is a great book to be used as a resource for anyone who wants to learn statistics or who wants to supplement a bulky A.P. or college stats book with something that gets to the essence of what statistics is about while also teaching how to solve stats problems.I especially liked the last chapter about the limits of statistical reasoning, something that is sorely needed in today's news world where articles are often called 'fake news,' it is good to get the techniques to evaluate such claims for yourself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Painless Statistics (Barrons Painless)

"I am surprised by the number of negative reviews for what I consider to be a nicely written, well thought out, and logically presented introductory course on mathematical statistics. Yes, a working knowledge of elementary calculus is a prerequisite. But the mathematics invoked in the exposition of concepts and theorems are kept as simple as possible while maintaining that modest level of rigor appropriate for a introductory exposition. If you do not have the minimal mathematical prerequisites (such as freshman calculus), blame your instructor or your school  for selecting an inappropriate text. But don't blame the authors! I thought the examples and problems were appropriate in their level of difficulty (mostly not so hard) and the relation to the material just covered. There are plenty of poorly written, impossibly dry, inpenetrable texts on statistics out there - this is not one of them. In addition, the book is attractively packaged, the paper quality is excellent, the visuals are informative and clearly presented - that also should not be taken for granted. Lastly the authors have a wicked entertaining sense of humor that spice the presentation throughout.  I consider this book to be a welcome addition to the set of modern textbooks available to the curious serious student of probability and statistics.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications An
This is now the third textbook I have had exposure to on this topic and I must say it is the best I have had so far. This book is very approachable and clearly lays out the concepts presented. The textbook provides a good amount of motivation for each topic before getting to a key theorem. The first 3 chapters are wordy but it gets better after that. For anyone looking for an introductory book on probability and statistics this one is your best option! My only complaint about this book is the section on transformations was lacking. Transformations is probably one of the hardest topics in statistics and the author really blew through this section without enough explanation or examples. Other than that this is a very well written text.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications An

"I went through this book assiduously.  On the +, the examples are wonderful and it is one book that actually shows you how stats can be used in real life to solve problems and get additional insights. How some clever stats conclude that Mark Twain is not Snodgrass, why Etruscans are not Italians, how perhaps humanity abide to some standard such as the golden rectangle etc.  On the -, and I am sad to say so, the book skips and saunters around the proofs (it never really head dive into it), lacks order and just whip-slash formulae to give a semblance of proofs while the steps and the minutiae are not there and leave us, mere mortals, more wanting. If you have a solid background in maths, and have been already educated by and walk with the Gods, then, perhaps you will be fine.  Perhaps you will take comfort in your erudition.  Since this is not my case and since I will destined to become food for mites, I had hoped the authors would actually guide us though the steps and educate us - give us a taste of ambrosia. I desperately wanted a Tensing Norgay, I wanted good hardy sherpas on this ascent, but that, it was not.  The maths demonstration never felt honest, not ""Russian"", not MIT-esque and was even cavalier at times. It felt akin to eating Macdonald burger bread when I wanted hand made French baguette.  I had several frustrated ""arrrggghh"" moments because I felt short changed on the explanation and was stuck.  There was no Aha! but rather lots of Arrrrrgh.  Most of the exercises are plugs and chugs. The ones that are not and require deeper thinking become inaccessible since we were not given the base from the outset. Which causes more frustration.  Hence, this book has an identity crisis which in turns, gives me my own identity crisis. It's a good date, a perfectly nice one but this person is just not the one I'm afraid. The authors, are, I am sure, very accomplished and I wish they can respond here.  Should you get this book? Yes get it. The examples alone are with the money. But will that book be the one? Will this be the ode that makes you cry? It did not do it for me. We got to the close of greatness but did not make it - in fact we barely got close to the event horizon. Lawrence Leemis' and Pishro Niks' books give you more of that feeling - I kept surreptitiously having 4am trysts with those two to understand Bayesian maths, estimators or just to delight in their explanations and the purity of their expose - which right there, says it all.

"This book is aimed at students in the social sciences, education and related subjects who have only a basic background in statistics and quantitative research design.  The emphasis is on the design and execution of research projects, and includes issues of planning and sampling, measurement, choice of statistical model, and interpretation  of results.  Frequently, the topics research design, measurement and statistics tend to be covered in three separate texts and any links are left to the struggling student or novice researcher, who too often finds it difficult to integrate these.  The aim of this book is to encourage researchers to consider all the assumptions and their interactions when making decisions during the planning of research.  They need to take into account the interrelationships between 'technologies' when designing the structure of the study, creating measuring instruments, collecting data, selecting statistical tools, and interpreting the results.  Therefore, the statistical tests are not just after-the-fact, but are used as part of the planning process to help make such decisions as sample size and desired reliability of instruments.The titles of the chapters are: Part I: Introduction to Research Design 1 The Nature of Enquiry 2 Beginning the Process 3 Initial Sources of Invalidity and Confounding 4 Basic Designs 5 Identifying Populations and Samples 6 Additional Sources of Confounding by the Measurement Process and  Interactions 7 Refining the DesignsPart II: Measurement Design 8 Principles of Measurement and Collecting Factual Data 9 Measuring Attitudes, Opinions and Views 10 Measuring Achievement 11 Evaluating Data Quality: Determining Instrument Reliability and ValidityPart III: Turning Data into Information Using Statistics 12 Descriptive Statistics Using a Spreadsheet 13 Probability and Statistical Significance 14 Power of Statistical Tests  Part IV: Ex Post Facto, Experimental, and Quasi-experimental Designs:  Parametric Tests 15 Comparing Two Groups: t-test 16 One-way Analysis of Variance: ANOVA 17 Factorial Designs 18 Randomised Block Designs and Analysis of CovariancePart V: Non-Parametric Tests: Nominal and Ordinal Variables 19 Nonparametric Tests: One- and Two-Sample 20 Nonparametric Tests: Multiple- and Related-SamplesPart VI:  Describing Non-causal Relationships 21 Correlation and Association 22 Regression",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design Measurement and Statistics

"TL:DR - Pros: Good for introductory students, and self-study review. Keypoints per section, and execute. Mistakes? Here's EXACTLY why!Cons: No laborious exposition on history/theory/definitions needed for later courses, BUT reminds you of algebraic/geometric 'theory' to show you why your problems are erroneous.Review:This is a great primer for someone that's starting Calculus or has already done classes and completely forgotten everything.It gives provides about a half-page of notes and keypoints, as if you just got done with the lecture.I remember in college getting so frustrated getting erroneous answers even using Stewerts Solution manual, chegg, wolfram alpha, AND the internet, and I would still be left clueless, distraught, stressed, and agrevating having to spend so much time to understand what I was doing wrong.This small booklet has got you covered!The book's notes and solution lets you know exactly what they're doing, even the 'trivial' algebra/trigonometry, which was the bane of me, and often provides the most enlightening.This book always lets you know ""hey remember that weird obscure algebraic principle your teacher told you 4 years ago and spent 45 seconds covering in-class"". Well here's why you use it, and how it relates to being operated under derivatives and integrals.Which I think is actually super useful for Mathematical Proofs courses later on, as people tend to have forgotten all the juicy bits and pieces of algebra and trig which this small booklet reminds you of.The book gives you the 'lecture notes' as if you just got out of class and says ""GO!"".The solutions give you such clear guidance for every step, and gives you the ""why"" did you just do that step ""how did you do that"" - 'this algebraic property/identity'The problems are also unique to give you new ideas to think about, as opposed to the 50 same original problems that you get tired and tedious of and 5 random extremely tough problems that you have nothing to connect them to.This book doesn't go over the theories and proofs, and history, etc, blah blah blah, that textbooks use to fill up the pages and bore the student to death to even attempt to read, let alone do the problems.Gives you the 'lecture notes' and says ""GO!"".The solutions give you such clear guidance for every step, and gives you the ""why"" did you just do that step ""how did you do that"" - 'this algebraic property/identity'The problems are also unique to give you new ideas to think about, as opposed to the 50 same original problems that you get tired and tedious of and 5 random extremely tough problems that you have nothing to connect them to.This book gives you unique problems, that give you progressively harder ideas to work with. Definitely not some of those crazy problems in textbooks, but it gives you the experience to tackle those head on.This book starts slightly ahead of College level Material at derivatives curriculum starts at limits. So I'm surprised someone said it's only useful for highschool.

Solutions are provided for the rest eventually, also with steps to help you see where you went wrong.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Essential Calculus Skills Practice Workbook with Full Solutions
Its a Amazing book. It shows me how the equation works and how it got to that conclusion!  This book made calculus easy.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Essential Calculus Skills Practice Workbook with Full Solutions
"I never thought a free book would be so helpful. I struggled with calculus my whole life and finally, returning to it as a hobby 15 years later, this book makes it much more accessible and relatable. Thanks for making the reading material accessible! Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Essential Calculus Skills Practice Workbook with Full Solutions
"This is meant to accompany a class to teach the essential skills. This workbook does not teach how to do the problems except in the most mechanical way.

"I’m a few chapters away from the end and can already say without doubt that this book is a lifesaver. I’m currently doing a course in quantitative finance and found myself falling behind on calculus really quickly. Upon reflection I admitted to myself that I didn’t even know the basics. Well, after ploughing through every exercise and example as far as the chapter on definite integrals, I no longer have anxiety looking at introductory-level calculus problems. The rules are clearly explained, and each exercise has a detailed answer which leaves no doubts as to how it was achieved. Ok, back to completing the last few chapters!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Essential Calculus Skills Practice Workbook with Full Solutions

"Just “yuck”! I had to retake Statistics because I got sick and had to drop the class. I loved it before my school changed to this text. This seems to be written more to prepare students to engage with statistics software than to teach mastery of the subject. The authors use definitions to define definitions rather than explaining vocabulary by applying it in the approach to a problem. They don’t explain other vocabulary words that suddenly appear in the exercises but you’re somehow supposed to intuitively know what they’re after. This MIGHT work if they actually explained their reasoning  thoroughly beforehand - or in the answer key to the odd exercise problems  - but they don’t.Instead, when you turn to the back of the book to make sure you followed instructions “a - e” and got the desired results, you’re greeted by “b” being partially answered (apparently it was important) and no input given as whether or not you have managed to correctly interpret raw data into a format that is understandable and easier to engage with for exercise subsets a - e minus b. Or, more to the point of this science,  if you can explain your findings to others… let alone discern if you’re prepared for exams. This sort of weirdness is happening in Chapter 2 which means that it’s going to be a very long term.This kind of ambiguity might be acceptable for graduate courses where one is expected to be able to develop arguments and defend opinions but in an introductory text, it’s inappropriate. I was getting an A last time…this may not be pretty. Sorry if you have to engage with this too. The book showed up (the second time) in good shape.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics

"Okay, so you have seen books to be or profess to be a book on statistics but this handy book shows a relationship and link to probability.  As an outline it has loads of new concepts, but does not require a lot of math to becoming accomplished in practice.

"I can give a list of bads this book, eps on Probability Theory part of it. No math rigidity at all is present in almost all well known theorems. Confusing notations and letters are also used in weird ways for no particular reason. Worked examples are not well explained.General speaking, this book is merely shoddy compilations of equations and formulas.  It is not for serious students who really want to learn and understand the theory, only for Exam preparation rush.Authors are all PhDs, but no good teachers for sure. The other book from Schaums by Hwei Hsu titled "" Probability, random variable, and random process"" is a much better book in every way.
