I think it would be better suited for someone who has already been studying machine learning for a while. I have a lot of python experience though, so that made things a little easier. I like that it tries to cover a ton of different things. The best thing about this book is that it covers a wide range of topics. But I feel like each topic in the book is explained very quickly. I had a lot of questions about each topic and had to Google a lot of stuff while reading it. It wasn't always clear why they were adding the layers that they were adding to the model. Or what the advantages and disadvantages of doing it that way was. If this book was a class, I probably wouldn't do so well on the final. Maybe someday I will get good enough at machine learning to be able to help the authors edit and improve the book. I do feel bad giving it a 2 star review because I can tell a lot of time and effort when to writing about this many…","review_stars":"2.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 and Keras: Regression ConvNets GANs RNNs NLP and more with TensorFlow 2 and the Keras API 2nd Edition","_deepnote_index_column":120},{"review_text":"This book has no details about Keras code, just broad strokes and mathematically meaningless explanations.Over 600 pages essay on deep learning for children.

I've been working as a deep-learning engineer for last 5 years.  I would say this is a great book to kickstart a career in a modern ML / Computer Vision domain. Compared to Goodfellow, it's way more practical in terms of what you need to know to actually build a good a model from scratch. It doesn't go into a deep math background. It doesn't cover 101 research branches that were undertaken in last 20 years but ended up not working in a field. It solely focuses on what exactly is being used in industry these days.On the cons side, I think, to be a good CV engineer there should be a pre-requisite to this book: a more classic computer vision course. So the reader has a better understanding where all those DL techniques should be put in a more broad CV world.Bottomline: Great tutorial.

I love how they use nontrivial examples. The kind of examples you can tweak the code a bit right out of the book and use it at work and look like a superstar. My dislike is that they didn’t focus on a single language, or segregate the different languages into dedicated duplicated chapters. Do pymc3 in the book and tensorflow probability in the online materials. Or vice versa. I understand their goal was to get readers to get familiar with multiple packages, but it’s a bit of a headache.  There are quite a few typos and misspellings.All that aside, I think this book is worth the money, and I can’t wait for the second edition. This is a great intro book to get started with Bayesian stats and probabilistic programming. It’s also pays a lot of attention to model diagnostics and the intricacies of Bayesian modeling.

Many analytics books are all theory and no practice. This book's case studies make concepts easy to grasp. Have read all of this author's books and I think this one my be the best.  Love the diversity of topics from sports to politics to healthcare and more.  I really like the way he tell you the story and then gives you the Excel calculations.  I think this makes the book enjoyable for us data nerds as well as those who aren't. According to Dr. Hal R.Varian, Google’s Chief Economist, \"The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.\" This 2009 quote talks about a skill known as data storytelling.Dr. Winston's \"Analytics Stories\" does a fantastic job at introducing the reader to data storytelling. He builds over 50 business cases that range from politics to baseball. Dr. Winston uses mostly MS Excel to make sense of data, process it, visualize it and communicate it in a compelling way.For example, chapter 52 applies the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model and extends the application to include demand uncertainty and reorder point. It also illustrates \"the power of two\" rule on inventory management. It sounds quite specialized, and it is, but it is written in a way that is fun to read and very visual. I teach logistics and supply chain management at college level and will use this chapter to teach the EOQ model to my students.On a completely different application, chapter 46 discusses whether roundabouts are a good idea or not. Chapter 41 uses data to talk about the causes of the 1854 London Cholera Outbreak, and so on.Analytics Stories is an outstanding resource for specialists and aficionados of data storytelling! Oh, what good fun this book was! It reminds me the most of Korner's \"The Pleasure of Counting\" in that each chapter presents a different case/problem/story and outlines the insights and the math used to untangle it. There's a ton of educational value too, aside from the analyses themselves. The topics range from politics, sports, education, policing, divorce, finance, traffic, drafts, etc... Metrics and jargon and clearly explained.It is extremely well documented as well: all sources for articles, texts, data, studies, etc. are cited in-paragraph for the reader's benefit. This alone increased my reading list considerably.The best part of the book is that for most of the chapters, Professor Winston presents a quantitative/statistical analysis of the story using Excel worksheets, which should make it accessible to the non-programming crowd. I myself enjoyed re-doing some of these in Python for some practice and to add reference code to my repos/library.Data scientists, statisticians, analysts, and curious readers will enjoy this book the most.Highest possible recommendation! What's so special about this book is that it's really trying to teach audiences at multiple levels. For beginners / people who have studied it all before (multiple times, for my part! And yet I forget all of the details), basic background statistics info is presented. It's quick, it's something that wouldn't bother those more familiar, but it helps ensure the others are keeping up. Highly recommended Great:The author covers a wide range of data challenges (61 chapters). Obviously, with so many chapters, it’s impossible to deep into any chapter. Some chapters are concise, and I wonder who the target audience is. Is it managers and MBAs?Bad:Chapter 5: How did Bernie Madoff keep his fund going?I wrote my Ph.D. thesis on Benford’s law and work as a Data Scientist (BenfordAnalytics) for a living. In short, the application of Benford’s law is lacking, saying the least. With 214 samples, we can only be 43.3% confident (my calculation) that Madoff cheated. In general, that’s not a high enough confidence level. In general, we aim for 90% or 95%. In summary, the reader gets a basic idea of applying Benford’s law, but that’s it.Don’t get me wrong; it’s an exciting book that tackles many analytics problems. However, the reader has to be aware that he has to dive deeper to apply the technique in the real world in any case.Franco"},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"ca77ee98","execution_start":1704485072509,"execution_millis":190,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"4e05ca4462c147699b82c156bd8ed891","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"display(Markdown(bert_summary))","block_group":"b5a271f0bd00493e9d6496b7ca091055","execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"I've been an analyst for four years now and I wish this book came out when I started.
