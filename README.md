# Data Science Books Analysis

## Overview

This project utilizes the Data Science Books dataset sourced from Kaggle, available at [Amazon Data Science Books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/amazon-data-science-books). The dataset provides information on a variety of books related to data science available on Amazon.

## To-dos

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 1. Do more expensive books have better reviews?

   - Conduct an analysis to determine the correlation between book prices and their reviews.
   - Explore whether higher-priced books tend to have more positive reviews.

#### 2. Do longer books have higher prices?

   - Investigate the relationship between the length of a book (in terms of pages) and its price.
   - Analyze whether longer books are generally priced higher.

### Best Python and Machine Learning Books

   - Identify and compile a list of the best Python books based on various factors such as ratings, reviews, and popularity.
   - Similarly, identify and compile a list of the best Machine Learning books using relevant criteria.

### Cluster Analysis

   - Perform cluster analysis on book names using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and K-means clustering.
   - Explore patterns and similarities in book titles to reveal potential categorizations.

### Amazon Review Scraping & Book Review Summary

   - Scrape additional reviews from Amazon for the data science books in the dataset.
   - Summarize the reviews to provide concise insights into the overall sentiments and key points.
